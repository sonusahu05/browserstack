			"During my time as a Fintech Intern at JPMorgan, I noticed a recurring challenge: every project required us to write code from scratch to automate repetitive tasks. This approach not only consumed a lot of time but also required deep coding knowledge, making it less accessible to the analysts who often had the domain expertise but not the technical skills.",
			"This experience sparked an idea for a no-code solution: a platform that allows users to create automation flows using a visual flowchart interface. The idea is simple: analysts could design workflows with logic and then have the system automatically generate executable code based on their flowchart design. This way, they wouldn’t need coding knowledge or a dedicated tech team to implement their solutions.",
			"I believe that such a platform could be a game-changer for companies, especially those in sectors like fintech, where automation is crucial but often requires a lot of technical expertise. With a no-code solution, analysts could easily build and deploy automation tools, saving time and increasing efficiency.",
			"I’m excited about the opportunity to work with BrowserStack on this idea. BrowserStack’s infrastructure and expertise could be the perfect environment to bring this no-code automation platform to life, and I believe it would be a valuable offering for many companies in the fintech and other industries that rely on automation.",
